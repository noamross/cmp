# An R Package for the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/noamross/compoisson.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noamross/compoisson)

This is a fork of Jeffery Dunn's 
[compoisson](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/compoisson/) package, which
implements distribution and fitting functions for the
[Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COMP) Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%E2%80%93Maxwell%E2%80%93Poisson_distribution).

Note that the actual installed name is `compoisson2` for now, so I can load both
and do performance comparisons.
