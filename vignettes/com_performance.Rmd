Here's a quick comparison of performance between the compoisson and compoisson2
packages.  In a first pass, I've improved speed by replacing two of the package
functions, `com.log.sum()` and `com.log.factorial()` with functions in the `base`
and `matrixStats` package that implement the same functions, but are written in
C.


```{r}
library(compoisson)
data("insurance")
library(microbenchmark)
com_fit_compare = microbenchmark(compoisson::com.fit(Lemaire), compoisson2::com.fit(Lemaire), times=500L)
summary(com_fit_compare)
```

We can an approximately 6-fold improvement right off the bat.
