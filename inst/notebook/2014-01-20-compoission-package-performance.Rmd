Here's a quick comparison of performance between the compoisson and compoisson2
packages.  In a first pass, I've improved speed by replacing two of the package
functions, `com.log.sum()` and `com.log.factorial()` with functions in the `base`
and `matrixStats` package that implement the same functions, but are written in
C.


We can an approximately 6-fold improvement right off the bat.
